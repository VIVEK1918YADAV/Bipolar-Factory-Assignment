# Bipolar Assignment

## Description

This project is part of the Bipolar Assignment and serves as a demonstration of different components such as Page, Forms, Cards, and Charts. The application is built using Next.js with Material-UI for styling and React Storybook for testing and showcasing the components.

# Thoughts
I had the chance to delve into Storybook for the first time, and the experience was quite fascinating. I am eager to deepen my understanding by exploring more of its features and functionalities.
While working with MaterialUI, I encountered some challenges that have sparked my interest in delving further into the framework. I believe overcoming these hurdles will significantly contribute to a more comprehensive grasp of MaterialUI's capabilities.
The challenges faced while using MaterialUI have fueled my curiosity to explore the framework more extensively. I see it as an opportunity for growth and a chance to master the intricacies of MaterialUI.
I have dedicated time to researching new technologies that can inject excitement into my work.
Considering your expertise, I am eager to seek your advice on the best ways to enhance my understanding of Storybook and MaterialUI. Additionally, if you have any recommendations for further research or learning resources, I would be grateful for your guidance.
